You are given a tree with 𝑛 vertices rooted at vertex 1. 

For some permutation† 𝑎 of length 𝑛 , let 𝑓(𝑎) be the number of pairs of vertices (𝑢,𝑣) such that 𝑎𝑢<𝑎lca(𝑢,𝑣)<𝑎𝑣 . Here, lca(𝑢,𝑣) denotes the lowest common ancestor of vertices 𝑢 and 𝑣. 

Find the maximum possible value of 𝑓(𝑎) over all permutations 𝑎 of length 𝑛. 

† A permutation of length 𝑛 is an array consisting of 𝑛 distinct integers from 1 to 𝑛 in arbitrary order. For example, [2,3,1,5,4] is a permutation, but [1,2,2] is not a permutation (2 appears twice in the array), and [1,3,4] is also not a permutation (𝑛=3 but there is 4 in the array).

<b>Input</b>
<ul>
<li>The first line contains a single integer t (1≤t≤100 ).</li>
<li>The second line contains a single integer 𝑛 (2≤𝑛≤5000 ).</li>
<li>The third line contains 𝑛−1 integers 𝑝2,𝑝3,…,𝑝𝑛 (1≤𝑝𝑖<𝑖) indicating that there is an edge between vertices 𝑖 and 𝑝𝑖.</li>
</ul>

<b>Output</b>
Output the maximum value of 𝑓(𝑎) .

<b>Note</b>
The tree in the first test:
One possible optimal permutation 𝑎 is [2,1,4,5,3] with 4 suitable pairs of vertices: 
(2,3) , since lca(2,3)=1 and 1<2<4 , 
(2,4) , since lca(2,4)=1 and 1<2<5 , 
(2,5) , since lca(2,5)=1 and 1<2<3 , 
(5,4) , since lca(5,4)=3 and 3<4<5 .
